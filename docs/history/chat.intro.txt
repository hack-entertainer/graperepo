You are continuing work on the **RRDB Laravel Project** — a reporting and judicial review platform currently in pseudo-production preparation, now entering the identity verification (IDV) integration phase.

### Project Context
- The Laravel codebase has been pruned and stabilized, retaining only reporting, messaging, user, and admin systems.
- All migrations have been rebuilt and verified across environments.
- Stripe payments are functional; SendGrid mail configuration is prepared but pending account activation.
- The application is fully deployed to staging and pseudo-production environments on Railway.
- The next milestone centers on implementing secure, auditable identity verification.

### New Update — November 2025
A complete **Identity Verification Provider Evaluation** was conducted to determine the most suitable solution for legally defensible, high-assurance verification (IAL2-equivalent or better).

#### Final Recommendation
**Veriff** was selected as the primary IDV provider, offering:
- IAL2-equivalent assurance with document + biometric verification
- Global coverage and GDPR/SOC 2 compliance
- Straightforward API with solid developer documentation
- Built-in liveness detection and optional video verification

A **manual escalation process** will be supported for exceptional legal cases requiring human or administrative review.

#### Providers Considered
- Veriff (chosen)  
- Onfido, Jumio, Thomson Reuters CLEAR, Socure  
- Stripe Identity, Trulioo, ID.me, Persona, Sumsub, AU10TIX, IDnow  

**Outcome:** Veriff selected as core IDV provider. Stripe Identity retained as a fallback for minimal-assurance workflows.

### Completed Milestones
1. Codebase pruning & route cleanup  
2. Database rebuild and migration validation  
3. Environment setup on Railway (local/staging/pseudo-production)  
4. HTTPS enforcement and environment parity fixes  
5. Responsive front-end optimization  
6. Stripe payment testing validated  
7. Cache, storage, and permissions fully repaired  
8. Initial SendGrid integration staged (awaiting activation)

### Next Objectives
1. **Veriff Integration**
   - Implement Veriff API for automated ID verification at registration.
   - Add webhook handling and verification status tracking.
   - Define escalation flow for manual or exception reviews.
2. **Cloudinary Integration**
   - Migrate media storage for reports, comments, and responses.
3. **ClamAV Scanning**
   - Introduce file scanning pre-upload; optional async microservice.
4. **Security Hardening**
   - Enforce signed URLs, MIME and file size validation, and access roles.
5. **Judicial Flow**
   - Implement juror assignment, review submission, verdict compilation, and archiving.
6. **Final QA & Launch Prep**
   - Conduct end-to-end smoke test, confirm Veriff flow, finalize documentation.

### Working Style
- Professional, implementation-focused, and production-oriented.
- Code must be secure, maintainable, and deployment-ready.
- No hotkeys or side menus — concise, contextual responses only.
- Assume Laravel boots cleanly across all environments.
- SendGrid is configured but not yet sending mail.
