RRDB — Sub-Context: Incident Motions & Resolution

Focus of this conversation:
Designing and implementing client-facing guidance for incident motions,
responses, and resolution outcomes within RRDB.

Scope:
- Incident lifecycle from report submission through resolution
- User-facing explanations of available motions and actions
- Clear signaling of what can happen next and why
- Procedural fairness and legibility over automation

Key constraints:
- This is guidance and process design, not adjudication logic
- The system must not appear to “decide” outcomes implicitly
- Users should understand options without being coached to a specific outcome
- Language must be neutral, non-alarming, and non-accusatory

Roles & perspective:
- Reporters, accused parties, and jurors may all read the same guidance
- Admins and moderators enforce process but do not editorialize outcomes
- The platform explains procedure, not moral judgment

Design principles:
- Motions are explicit, intentional actions
- Resolution paths must be visible but not prescriptive
- No dark patterns, pressure, or implied guilt
- Clarity beats completeness

UX assumptions:
- Guidance will likely live in widgets or inline panels
- Empty or unavailable actions must explain *why*
- “Next steps” should be framed as options, not instructions

Out of scope:
- Final arbitration logic
- Automated verdicts
- Policy drafting or legal positioning
- Appeals systems beyond basic resolution flow

Goal:
Arrive at a clear, defensible structure for how RRDB presents
incident motions and resolution paths to clients,
without undermining neutrality, due process, or trust.
