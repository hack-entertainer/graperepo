Troubleshooting Guide

This document records known failure modes
and their observed resolutions.

Guiding rules:
- Assume caching before assuming logic bugs
- Verify runtime before changing code
- Reproduce locally when possible

Common issues:
- Route cache mismatches
- Seeder wiring omissions
- Permission issues in Docker volumes
- Upload failures due to server configuration

This is a living document.
Add entries only after root cause is understood.
